## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to round corners of an image and understood the actual use of overflow property.

Here are the snippets

```html
<figure>
  <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr code">
</figure>
```
```css
.container figure {
  background-color: rgba(31, 50, 81, 0.1);
  border-radius: 20px;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would continue learning better semantics and incorporating flexbox into bigger projects so that I can have a strong command over it. 
Along with flexbox, I am learing to use grid. Would be creating more projects incorporating both grid and flexbox.
